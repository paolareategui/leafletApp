# ðŸŒ± leaflet App ðŸŒ±

Leaflet is a short-form journal app for plant parents developed
using React Native and Expo.

Leaflet allows the user to save journal entries about their
beloved plant babies. Each entry can record one image, a plant
category and up to 240 characters of text. Additionally, leaflet
users can edit and delete their entries. In order to use the app,
leaflet requires an account.

This is a project for COMP3130 Mobile Application Developement
at Macquarie University.
